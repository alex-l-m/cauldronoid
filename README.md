# cauldronoid

Fluently move between three different perspectives on a collection of molecules: tidy data, specialized chemistry packages, and machine learning datasets.

The name is meant to suggest three witches around a cauldron, such as the ones from Macbeth.
One witch is a machine learning engineer, one is a cheminformaticist, and one is a statistician.
They are all concerned with the same molecules, contained within the cauldron.
However, since the cauldron is actually a computer, it is a "cauldronoid", just as a mechanical human is an "android".
